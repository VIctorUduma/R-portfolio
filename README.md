# R-portfolio
This is a collection of my R projects 

For my first project I perform EDA on a insurance dataset, I then use multiple linear regression to determine if there is a relationship between the cost of a indiviual medical bills and their BMI,age, which region of the unites states they come from,whether or not they smoke and if they have children or not.

For my second project I performed EDA using a Diabetes dataset, I created a binary logstic regression model to determine if there is a relationship between diabetes and age, gender, and BMI.
